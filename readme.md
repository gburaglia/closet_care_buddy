# Supporting Closet Organization with AI
This application was created for the class LMC 8803 GM1 AI 4 DM taught by Brian Magerko and Manoj Deshpande at Georgia Tech. The project goal is to support individuals during closet decluttering by:  
1. **Describing Clothing Items**: Using AI to generate detailed captions for clothing items under consideration.  
2. **Providing Outfit Inspiration**: Generating AI-based outfit inspiration ideas to encourage creative reuse of clothing.  

## Technical Specifications
Flask application
OpenAI model: gpt-4o
OpenAI model: DALLE-3
RAG datasource: Image captions generated by Salesforce BLIP pre-trained model

## Instructions
Once your virtual environment is active: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Create an ".env" file to store all the environment variables for Flask, Huggingface, OpenAI & Langchain. Copy this code into the ".env" file. And complete with your hugging face and openai keys.
- `FLASK_APP = app`
- `FLASK_RUN_PORT = 8080`
- `FLASK_DEBUG = True`
- `HF_TOKEN = ""`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY = ""`  

## Steps 

### Step 1: Capture Image 
- **Process**:  
  - Using live camera feed, users are able to capture a picture for use downstream.

### Step 2: Producing Detailed AI Generatred Caption
- **Input**: Captured image of the clothing item from step 1.
- **Process**:  
  - Utilizes a simple RAG using **LangChain's ImageCaptionLoader** with Salesforce BLIP pre-trained model for basic image captions.  
  - Employs **gpt-4o** model to refine the basic caption into a detailed description.
- **Output**: Detailed caption displayed on the screen.

### Step 3: Creating Outfit Inspiration  
- **Input**: Detailed AI generated caption from step 2.  
- **Process**:  
  - Detailed prompt generated using **LangChain** with a system and human prompt plus the detailed AI generated caption.  
  - Image generation executed using **OpenAI DALLE-3** for a visual outfit inspiration.  
- **Output**: Generated outfit image and the detailed prompt used for the image generation displayed on screen.

## Reasearch Motivation

### Methodology  
- **Approach**: Contextual Inquiry of users cleaning out their closets.  
- **Demographics**:  
  - Participants: Ages 25-58  
  - P1: Student | P2: Technology Consultant | P3: Homemaker  
- **Frequency of Decluttering**:  
  - Infrequent: Every few years (P1, P2) or 1-2 times a year (P3)
- **Motivations**:  
  - Extra time availability, noticing old or unused clothing

### Key Findings and Design Requirements  
| User Finding                                                                                               | Design Requirement                                                            | Incorporation                                                                                                            |

| Users consider an item's comfort, fit, and material. The frequency an item is worn, utility, uniqueness, associated memories, and wear/tear. Users want to sort clothing by color and style. They want more organization and closet space. Users want a second opinion on styling, look, fit, and wear/tear. | Support users in evaluating and categorizing clothing on various objective and subjective qualities. | Provided a detailed yet concise AI generated image caption to support user evaluation of clothing. |
| Users do not want to throw away clothing, want to donate or upcycle. Users are excited by rediscovering unused clothing. | Communicate idea of donating and upcycling through visual language.            | Still pending not incorporated.                                                                                         |
| Users are proud of their personal style and see this as a form of self-expression.                        | Allow users to retain autonomy and personal style identity.                     | Allow users the option to regenerate outfit inspiration and give them the option to see the AI prompt used for the image generation to support autonomy. |
